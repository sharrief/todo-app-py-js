# Fetching data
[FormController.js](/javascript/public/scripts//FormController.js) contains an example of making a typical HTTP request. The code is self-explanatory. `fetch` is another example of a global variable provided by browsers and is available to JavaScript when executed in a browser environment. Modern versions of NodeJS (>=18) also contain a `fetch` with a similar interface.
